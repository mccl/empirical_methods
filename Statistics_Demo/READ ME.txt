Hi Mike-Ok, here are the relevant files. All told, there are six, and this is the naming convention: the composer is given first ("beet" is for Beethoven), followed by 'v' (for violin), followed by either 1 or 2 (1 being the first violin).Each v1 file has all of the first violin notes in all of the string quartets by that given composer, for example. There are no other details, just a list of 112,475 first violin notes in the case of Haydn, etc. The only piece of information on each line is the pitch height of the note; in other words, rhythmic value, dynamic, etc. is all missing. Moreover, it should be noted that each note head gets a value: what this means is that tied notes get more than one value. I can change it if need be.ÊIf you want to redo the command that produced these files, and tweak anything yourself, here it is:for i in op*.krn; do extract -i '**kern' $i | extract -f '$' | semits -x | rid -GLId | grep -v ^= | grep -v r | tr ' ' '\n'; done >> haydnv1That's for violin 1. If, instead, you want violin 2 replace extract -f '$' with extract -f '$-1'. That's also for the Haydn files. If, instead you want Beethoven replace the op*.krn at the beginning with quart*.krn, If you want Mozart, replace it with k*.krn.ÊI figured that for the purpose of making graphs and doing stats, it'd be better to have the raw data rather than any sort of summary. If you'd rather have a summary, just let me know.Hope that helps!
